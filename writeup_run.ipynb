    "First, I converted the input images to grayscale, then I preform addtional gaussian blur to smooth out the image by using a kernal size of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I use Canny transform using `low_threshold = 30` `high_threshold = 150` to extract the edge points. Here is the Canny transform result of \"whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg\"\n",

    "Next is to define the mask of interest. Instead of use a fixed number, I used a Trapezoid mask and set the mask height as 3/4 of total image height. I set top width as 150. I also included a 50 pixel offset at bottom of trapezoid using bottom two points as `(0+corner_offset,imshape[0])` `(imshape[1]-corner_offset,imshape[0])`\n",

    "The `masked_edge` is the input of the hough line function. I used below parameters to run hough transformation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "rho = 1 # distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid\n",
    "    theta = np.pi/180 # angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid\n",
    "    threshold =  10 # minimum number of votes (intersections in Hough grid cell)\n",
    "    min_line_length = 10 #minimum number of pixels making up a line\n",
    "    max_line_gap = 30 # maximum gap in pixels between connectable line segments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the `hough_lines`, I called my improved draw line function `cum_ave_lines`.\n",
    "#### Improved Draw Lines Comparing Previous Results\n",
    "`cum_ave_lines` calls for two more function called `process_line_ave` and `sort_lines_compare_ave`. \n",
